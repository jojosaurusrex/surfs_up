# Surfs Up

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7.11

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this challenge was to have students practice what they just learned from  SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. In order to be able learn one way to retrieve data online, analyze it using Flask, and prepare Flask routes.

## Results
The purpose of this challenge was to have students familariaze themselves with PostgreSQL. There was data provided which the students used to:
- retrieve data online
- save it
- store it in a dataframe
- plot it
- write a working query
- analyze temperature  in order to find best months to go surfing in Hawaii


## Summary
According to our summary statistics for both June and December it is always a great temperature to go surfing in Hawaii, with both months averaging over 71 degrees Farhenheit. The two additional queries I would do on top of analyzing the temperature is to analyze the precipitation among both of these months. If we know when it is more likely to rain we can make sure to vacation in Hawaii when we can get the warm sunny days everyone pictures when they think of Hawaii.
